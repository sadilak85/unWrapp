# unWrapp

Time has come to unwrap an app from your beloved one!

Give him/her a self made, personalized app as a present or suprise!

## Getting Started

1) There are two parties, one is the creator (sender) and the other one is receiver.
2) The receiver obtains a code created automatic after finalizing the personal app by the creator (sender):

3) The "sender" must swipe to the login page to create the app:

4) Login is crucial for Firebase Authentication (Email/Pass). 
5) After login, user selects a template to ease the pain, or select to do it from scratch (Create a design)

6) Personal information such as the structure of the app (Background, text, albums, names, etc) is saved in Realtime Database as JSon data.
7) Pictures/Videos in Storage need also this authentication , so we need a first time authentication (compulsory)
